# CPE019---de-Leon

Good Day! I am Bryan Paul de Leon from CPE32S3. I am excited to learn more about this course, most notably the machine learning and data science topics, as I am deeply interested in learning more about this field, and possibly have it as my future career path. Although coding is not my forte, I will do my best to cope up with  my knowledge deficits and make this a good learning experience for me!
